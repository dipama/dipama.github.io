{"name":"taiyoML","tagline":"","body":"![taiyoML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dipama/dipama.github.io/master/Sun.png)\r\ntaiyoML is a machine learning startup, devoted to the availability of accurate prediction of energy production from zero-carbon energy sources like solar and wind power to provide flexibility for basic usability, but also for the other possible practical applications such as energy deployment-on-demand and high energy production contracts. Estimates based on complex multivariate forecasting equations or formulae tend to err in any capacity for continuous prediction because of the inflexibility inherent in fixed equations when dealing with variability in climatic conditions and in the complexity of energy production patterns.  To counter this issue, I took a cloud based approach to photovoltaic predictions, using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning services coupled with an internet of things approach for data collection from the photovoltaic sets that were tested.  Using a low-feature, many-model approach with available weather data, I was able to achieve a 91% prediction accuracy for the real power output. Using Azure Machine Learning based operationalized web services, and cloud integration to make bulk predictions possible, photovoltaic predictions should only require a connection between the various aspects of the data flow, allowing both large photovoltaic plants and small household sets to accurately predict power output using minimal weather data.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
